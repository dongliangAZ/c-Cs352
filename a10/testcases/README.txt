The test cases for Assignment 10 are called exactly the same way as they
are for Assignment 9. Please see the README.txt file in that area for details.
There are a few more testcases for 10 than for 9, but they are called the
same way. One difference is that the test scripts for Assignment 10 must
write temporary files to the directory in which they are run. They clean these
up again, but if you have files named the same then the will be WIPED OUT.
So if you have files named _testTarg* or _testDep* (the * is a wildcard
and will be replaced by any string) in your directory you want
to save, you should move them before running the scripts. I tried to use names
people were unlikely to have used. Notice that all these files start with an
underscore '_'.
